# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Verification:**

   - [ ] Verify webhook URL is in **Production** mode
   - [ ] Test webhook with Postman or curl

4. **Update Google Sheet ID**
   - [ ] Sheet ID: `1KYZKI2r86lkqPxNoe-SFaAqTuGOzz8LtU0lpRVXQlmc`
   - [ ] Or use your own sheet ID
   - [ ] Verify sheet has correct column headers

   - [ ] Redeploy to Railway

2. **Update CORS**
   ```python
   CORS(app, resources={
       r"/scrape": {
           "origins": ["https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io"],
           "methods": ["POST", "OPTIONS"]
       }
   })
   ```
   - [ ] Update CORS with your exact GitHub Pages URL
   - [ ] Commit and push

3. **API Key Protection** (Optional)

   - [ ] Google Sheets: Set up quota monitoring

2. **Log Monitoring**
   - [ ] Check Railway logs daily (first week)
   - [ ] Review n8n execution history
   - [ ] Monitor OpenAI API usage
